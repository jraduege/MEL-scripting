[.ankleinst2][For range of motion: draw the alphabet with your foot
For strength:
Use a piece of furniture that won't move away when you push against it.   Put the inner side of your foot against it and push 25 times.
Do the same thing with the outer side of your foot 25 times.
Loop a towel around the underside of your foot and hold it so that it doesn't move and push down against it 25 times.
